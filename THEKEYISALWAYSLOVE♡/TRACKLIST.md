“Show me the tracks!”

The title might suggest this document is a *TRACKLIST* for the album *THE KEY IS ALWAYS LOVE ♡*, but in reality it is more than that.  It lists the albums' tracks in order, along with the samples used to make them — but it also lists some xtra information.

## Summary
*THE KEY IS ALWAYS LOVE ♡ was:*
- **Arranged by:** *Layla Parker*
- **As performed by / on:** *multiple artists and/or mediums, and/or (all artists of each sample)*
- **Written by:** *multiple songwriters, and/or (all songwriters of each sample)*

*All tracks on *THE KEY IS ALWAYS LOVE ♡* will forever be free of price.*

For more information, you can view the album at [its Bandcamp Webpage](https://tamberoo.bandcamp.com/album/the-key-is-always-love).

## Preface
This is an assemblage of mashups I have made over the past five-ish years.  This is also a story about growing out of suffocating relationships.

> *Keep your chin high, my friends, and your fists higher!  The revolution starts in your heart!  We will outlive them!  Hope is a hammer, hope is a force!  I love you, I hope you are doing well!*

Although there is a loose concept tying the album together, it's one that's based mostly on my own experiences, so you are free to conceptualise it based on yours.  There are no hidden tracks on the album.

All samples for each track are listed in the order of appearance per *track*, but for some tracks some samples technically appear at the same time.  There are also **“As Performed By / On”** and **“Written By”** sections for each of these, so as to give proper credit where necessary.  If a sampled track contains a `~` inside the “Written By” section, it means that the sampled song's songwriters were *also* credited as its “As Performed By / On” section.

### Thanks
Many indebted thanks to:
- The *unknown graffiti artist* who painted the message shown on the album art, who painted that up on that short train bridge near the Boise Depot(?), along with the other queer graffiti there.  I love you all and if you ever see this please reach out to me.
- So so so many queer friends I have made and lost, kept and cherished, all along the way, all towards the sun that won't set yet.  Without you I wouldnt be, and I hope I am returning the favor all the time.
- Free software developers who make it easier for people to work with technology and art without sacrificing their soul.
- *Many* artists whose works I used to make these mashups.  These sampled works are incredible in their own right and should be appreciated, so go to the full sample list and buy like.  Every song from it.  Give the original artists money, not me.
